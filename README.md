# Loan-Approval-Prediction-
loan approval prediction based on a dataset (loan_approval_dataset.csv), we'll go through several steps: data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, visualization of results, and finally creating a GUI using tkinter for interaction. 
The dataset consists of several columns, including features related to loan applicants and the target variable loan_status. Here's a brief overview of the columns:

1.  loan_id: Identifier for each loan application.
2.  no_of_dependents: Number of dependents.
3.  education: Educational background of the applicant.
4.  self_employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed.
5.  income_annum: Annual income.
6.  loan_amount: Amount of the loan.
7.  loan_term: Duration of the loan.
8.  cibil_score: Credit score.
8.  residential_assets_value: Value of residential assets.
10. commercial_assets_value: Value of commercial assets.
11. luxury_assets_value: Value of luxury assets.
12. bank_asset_value: Value of bank assets.
13. loan_status: Approval status of the loan (target variable).

**detailed breakdown of the projects:**

**Data Loading and Understanding:**
  Load the dataset (loan_approval_dataset.csv) and understand its structure, features, and target variable (e.g., Loan_Status).

**Data Preprocessing:**
  Handle missing values: Impute or drop missing data depending on the amount of missingness and the nature of the data.
  Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Understand the distribution of the target variable (Loan_Status) and explore relationships between features and the target.
Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns using plots such as histograms, bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots.

**Feature Engineering:**
  Create new features that might improve model performance based on domain knowledge or insights gained from EDA.

**Model Selection and Training:**
  Choose appropriate machine learning models for binary classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
  Split the data into training and testing sets.
  Train the models on the training data.

**Model Evaluation:**
  Evaluate models using appropriate metrics like accuracy,MAE,MSE .

**Visualization and Interpretation:**
  Visualize model performance metrics (e.g. confusion matrix) to assess how well the model predicts loan approval.
  Interpret the model: Understand which features are most influential in predicting loan approval using feature importance plots or coefficients from models like Logistic Regression.

**Creating GUI using tkinter**
GUI Design:
  Use tkinter to design a user-friendly interface for loan approval prediction.
  Include input fields for relevant features (e.g., income, credit score, loan amount).
  Add buttons for submitting inputs and displaying predictions.
Integration:
  Integrate the trained model into the tkinter GUI.
  Capture user inputs and preprocess them accordingly (similar to the preprocessing done during model training).
  Display predicted loan approval status (e.g., approved or rejected) based on the model's prediction.

**summary of visualization techniques used in this process:**
  Histograms and Bar Plots: Show distribution of numerical and categorical variables respectively.
  Box Plots: Visualize distributions and identify outliers.
  Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between numerical variables.
  Heatmaps: Display correlations between variables.
  ROC Curves: Evaluate model performance by showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
  Confusion Matrix: Summarize the performance of a classification model.
  
**results**
Prints the importance of the features and compare accuracy of the model.
Prints the accuracy of the model, which tells us how many loan approvals were predicted correctly.
